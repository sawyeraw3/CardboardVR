C# scripts used in my Cardboard VR Unity3D games

I began scripting in C# with Unity3D during the summer of 2015. These scripts represent the more specialized features in my games, and are a sample from the games I've been developing. As I continue to teach myself more about the language and game engine, I'll refine my scripts and add more.
